                    <p>March 2015 marked the beginning of my journey with photography in the mountains of Western North Carolina. I was an avid explorer of the outdoors, 
                        identifying wildlife and flora on my adventures.</p>
                    <p>Since then, I have hiked around the Grand Canyon, walked the streets of Montreal, and traversed down rivers in the Florida Everglades. 
                        By exploring the outdoors, I have come to appreciate the diverse environments found all across our continent.</p>

                <article class="section-2 intro box col-sm-11 col-md-6 col-lg-6 col-xl-6">
                    <p>After years of nature photography, I became curious about other photography types. I taught myself a lot, and after hours of practice, I was able to fully understand the manual controls of my camera. I couldn't wait to see what I could do!</p>
                    <p>The first opportunity that I had to put my skills to the test was through volunteering for the 
                        <a href="https://folkmoot.org/" target="_blank">Folkmoot International Dance Festival</a>. This festival embraces global diversity and aspires to promote peace throughout the world. I have volunteered there for 2 years so far, and I had the amazing chance to befriend performers from more than 12 different countries.</p>
                    <p>Three years after starting nature photography, I entered my first year at the 
                        <a href="https://www.unc.edu/" target="_blank">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> as a Biology Major and Chemistry Minor. I was involved with photography outside of my studies, doing nature photography around campus as well as taking pictures at swim meets for my club team and intramural teams.</p>

                <article class="section-3 intro box col-sm-11 col-md-8 col-lg-6 col-xl-6">
                    <p>In the fall of my sophomore year, I enrolled in a photography class through the 
                        <a href="http://hussman.unc.edu/" target="_blank">Hussman School of Journalism and Media</a>, one of the best 
                        journalism schools in the country, where I learned the foundations for how to be 
                        a great portrait photographer and photojournalist. This class changed my perspective 
                        of photography and challenged my previous self-taught knowledge in many ways. 
                        Through this class, I was able to secure my first paid job opportunity as a photographer 
                        at a bar in Chapel Hill.</p>
                    <p>Now, after more than 5 years of experience with photography, I started my own business.</p>
                    <p><i>My goal was and continues to be to help others discover themselves through photography.</i></p>
                    <p>Looking back, I’m grateful for all of the experiences that I’ve had. My early days as a 
                        nature photographer have taught me to be curious, adventurous, and bold. Volunteering for 
                        the international dance festival and my communities taught me more about diversity, 
                        tradition, and culture. Taking the photography class allowed me to build on my previous 
                        skills to benefit others.</p>
                    <p>I am currently a junior, and I am starting down another road of discovery that leads to 
                        my future career of becoming a physician assistant. This calls for a lot of studying and 
                        a lot of dedication. However, there is always time for photography. If you see me taking 
                        pictures in the Quad or around UNC's campus, introduce yourself and I would love to get to 
                        know you.</p>

    <!-- NECESSARY <script> LINKS. The three <script> links below add jQuery, popper.js, and Bootstrap 4 JavaScript. These are libraries of scripts that are necessary to make Bootstrap's interactive and animated components work (e.g., dropdown menus, buttons, alerts, carousels, collapsing navbars and content areas, modals, popups, tooltips, etc). These three <script> links MUST appear in THIS ORDER; this is because both popper.js and the Bootstrap scripts rely on jQuery to work, so jQuery must load into your page first. We add these links at the bottom of the <body> element instead of in the <head> element so the scripts won't be loaded into your site until they're needed, which helps with your site's speed and functionality. -->
