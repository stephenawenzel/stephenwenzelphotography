                <p class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 mt-5 mb-5">
                    I've been interested in discovering new things ever since I was young, including various foods and wildlife. My first sense of actual
                    photography, rather than using my phone, was through my grandfather's old Canon T4 Rebel back in 2015. I adventured the
                    outdoors in my backyard in Clyde, North Carolina and hiked the Great Smoky Mountains in search of animals and plants that I haven't seen before.
                </p>
                <p class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 mt-5 mb-5">
                    In 2018, I discovered event photography through volunteering for our town's local international festival, Folkmoot USA. This fesival
                    promoted cultural diversity in our hometown as well as in the world. It was also where my parents met! I loved photographing the various
                    folk dances from around the world, with my favorite folk groups being from Romania, Egypt, and Mexico. 
                </p>
                <p class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 mt-5 mb-5">
                    In the fall of 2018, when I moved to college at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I shared my interest with my new friends.
                    They convinced me to turn my passion into a business, and so I did. I started a website, worked for a local nightclub, and created my first online store
                    where I sold nature photography. 
                </p>
                <p class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 mt-5 mb-5">
                    It wasn't until the spring of 2019 when I began to take senior portraits for college graduates that I realized how much I loved 
                    portrait photography. I began to invest so much of my time to improving my portrait photography that I began to lose sight of why I began photography in the first place, to explore
                    the world. So, I made it my goal to capture the diversity of the world through my camera, looking at people and their talents from a new angle.
                </p>
                <p class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 mt-5 mb-5">
                    That fall I took my first ever photography class, which changed the way I did photography forever. I learned how to use the equipment, how to think
                    more creatively, and how to communicate with clients. I never thought that I would end up using camera gels, light rods (they look like lightsabers), and long shutter speeds to capture what
                    looks like rays of light protruding out of the subject. I was so happy that I had a new spark for photography, and I haven't lost it since.
                </p>
                <p class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 mt-5 mb-5">
                    My goal now is to create professional portraits but also to add a creative twist or angle that is different than other photographers. I am primarily
                    interested in capturing the emotions that people feel when they are doing something that they love to do, whether it be playing a sport, making music, or 
                    cooking (I did a photoshoot for Cold Stone, Mellow Mushroom, and a local restaurant in Chapel Hill).

We were able to try a lot of locations and poses, and we never had any real conflict over what we were able to do.  When I decided to get a few more photos, we were able to schedule a super convenient mini-shoot to take a few more pictures.  We had a few scheduling conflicts, but Stephen was very flexible the whole time and was able to work with my changing schedule.
